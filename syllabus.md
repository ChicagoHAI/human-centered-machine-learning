Syllabus for Human-centered Machine learning (CMSC 35401, Spring 2022)
===========================

## Course description and goals

Machine learning is everywhere, but how can we incorporate machine learning systems into our society? The answer depends on the situation. In this course, we will take a human-centered approach and explore the societal impacts of machine learning and how machine learning systems can assist individuals and the society as a whole.


## Approach

We have two lectures per week and each student is expected to present (lead the discussion) twice in class. As a crucial step of research is to come up with a good research question, we will ask each student to write two research proposals in this class.
Each proposal will be at most five pages and is expected to identify a research question, explain why it is a good research question, and propose a tentative plan to address it (e.g., computational models, experiment designs, etc).
The final project will be done in groups with at most two or three people depending on class size.

### Preliminary topics (check course page for updated schedule)

We will examine the following topics this quarter: biases, accountability, interpretable machine learning, and human-AI interaction. We will read related papers to help us understand research in these areas.

### Required background

Mathematical background:
Linear algebra, probability, calculus, and statistics. Students are expected to have basic knowledge about machine learning.

Programming: Students are expected to be familiar with coding related to machine learning applications. Knowledge of scikit-learn and deep learning packages such as tensorflow, pytorch, and keras would be useful.

### Course evaluation

You can choose to take the course as an elective or a seminar.

If you choose the elective option, you will be evaluated as follows and get letter grades:

* proposals (2 times, 20%)
* course presentation (1 time, 10%)
* peer feedback (15%)
* final project (45%)
* participation (10%)

If you choose the seminar option, you will need to present once and participate in over 80% of the lectures to pass.


### Late policy
We do not allow for any late submissions.

##  Course policies

### Policy on academic honesty

We take academic honesty very seriously in this class. Please make sure to read the UChicago Academic Honesty [page](http://college.uchicago.edu/advising/academic-integrity-student-conduct). For code-related policies, we will follow the same [policy](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2020/fall/12100-1/honesty.html) as CS 121.

### Diversity statement
The University of Chicago is committed to diversity and rigorous inquiry that arises from multiple perspectives. We concur with that commitment and also believe that we have the highest quality interactions and can creatively solve more problems when we recognize and share our diversity. We thus expect to maintain a productive learning environment based upon open communication, mutual respect, and non-discrimination. We view the diversity that students bring to this class as a resource, strength and benefit. It is our intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, religious background, and immigration status. Any suggestions as to how to further such a positive and open environment in the class will be appreciated and given serious consideration.

If you have a preferred name different from what appears on the class roster, or preferred gender pronouns you would like us to use, please let us know.

### Accessibility statement
The University of Chicago is committed to ensuring equitable access to our academic programs and services. Students with disabilities who have been approved for the use of academic accommodations by Student Disability Services (SDS) and need a reasonable accommodation(s) to participate fully in this course should follow the procedures established by SDS for using accommodations. Timely notifications are required in order to ensure that your accommodations can be implemented. Please meet with me to discuss your access needs in this class after you have completed the SDS procedures for requesting accommodations.
