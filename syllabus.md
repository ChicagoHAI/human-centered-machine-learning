Syllabus for Human-centered Machine learning (CMSC 35401, Spring 2021)
===========================

## Course description and goals

Machine learning is everywhere, but why do we need machine learning systems? The answer depends on the situation. In this course, we will take a human-centered approach and explore the societal impacts of machine learning and how machine learning systems can assist humans in various tasks to improve the ability of humans.


## Approach

We have two lectures per week and each student is expected to present (lead the discussion) twice in class. As a crucial step of research is to come up with a good research question, we will ask each student to write two research proposals in this class.
Each proposal will be at most five pages and is expected to identify a research question, explain why it is a good research question, and propose a tentative plan to address it (e.g., computational models, experiment designs, etc).
The final project will be done in groups with at most two or three people depending on class size.

### Preliminary topics (check course page for updated schedule)

We will examine the following topics this quarter: biases, accountability, interpretable machine learning, and human-AI interaction. We will read related papers to help us understand research in these areas.

### Required background

Mathematical background:
Linear algebra, probability, calculus, and statistics. Students are expected to have basic knowledge about machine learning.

Programming: Students are expected to be familiar with coding related to machine learning applications. Knowledge of scikit-learn and deep learning packages such as tensorflow, pytorch, and keras would be useful.

### Course evaluation

You can choose to take the course as an elective or a seminar.

If you choose the elective option, you will be evaluated as follows and get letter grades:

* proposals (2 times, 20%)
* course presentation (1 time, 10%)
* peer feedback (15%)
* final project (45%)
* participation (10%)

If you choose the seminar option, you will need to present once and participate in over 80% of the lectures to pass.


### Late policy
We do not allow for any late submissions.

##  Course policies

### Policy on academic honesty

We take academic honesty very seriously in this class. Please make sure to read the UChicago Academic Honesty [page](http://college.uchicago.edu/advising/academic-integrity-student-conduct). For code-related policies, we will follow the same [policy](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2020/fall/12100-1/honesty.html) as CS 121.

### Zoom guidelines

We will be using Zoom in this class. We expect your interactions via Zoom to be consistent with an in-person class experience. Respect the people you’re working with. Enter the Zoom meetings muted if possible (unfortunately, it will not be possible if you’re calling in), and unmute to speak. Raise your hand if you’d like to speak. [There’s a “Raise Hand” button on the participant page.] If your background is unusually noisy, use the chat channel instead of unmuting. We strongly encourage you to have your camera on during our Zoom sessions, but we’ll understand if some of you prefer to keep your video off.

Note that you can set your name in your Zoom profile, so you don’t have to go with whatever was assigned. We encourage you to include your pronouns in your name (if so, please include them after your last name).

Our Zoom class meetings will be recorded and saved to the cloud to allow students in this class to review the discussion, and especially to allow students who can’t participate the opportunity to benefit from class. We will not make these recordings available to anyone but class participants, we will not make them available after the quarter, and students will not be allowed to save copies. However, we have no way to guarantee that students will follow this policy. If you have FERPA concerns, please mask yourself accordingly, e.g., by turning off video and using an alias.

### Diversity statement

The University of Chicago is committed to diversity and rigorous inquiry that arises from multiple perspectives. We concur with that commitment and also believe that we have the highest quality interactions and can creatively solve more problems when we recognize and share our diversity. We thus expect to maintain a productive learning environment based upon open communication, mutual respect, and non-discrimination. We view the diversity that students bring to this class as a resource, strength and benefit. It is our intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, religious background, and immigration status. Any suggestions as to how to further such a positive and open environment in the class will be appreciated and given serious consideration.

If you have a preferred name different from what appears on the class roster, or preferred gender pronouns you would like us to use, please let us know.

### Accessibility statement

The University of Chicago is committed to ensuring equitable access to our academic programs and services. Students with disabilities who have been approved for the use of academic accommodations by Student Disability Services (SDS) and need a reasonable accommodation(s) to participate fully in this course should follow the procedures established by SDS for using accommodations. Timely notifications are required in order to ensure that your accommodations can be implemented. Please meet with me to discuss your access needs in this class after you have completed the SDS procedures for requesting accommodations.

### COVID-19 Policies

#### UChicago Health Pact

All students on campus are required to adhere to the guidelines in the UChicago Health Pact in order to promote a safe environment in the classroom.

Secure face coverings must be worn appropriately at all times while in University buildings.

Maintain a distance of 6 feet from others.

Do not attend an in-person class if you feel unwell or are experiencing COVID-19 related symptoms.

The complete text of the UChicago Health Pact along with additional information about COVID-19 protocols can be found [here](https://goforward.uchicago.edu/health-requirements/#healthpact).

#### Reporting COVID-19 Related Concerns

Any concerns over inappropriate PPE usage, physical distancing, cleaning/disinfection, or other COVID-19 related public health concerns should be directed to [UCAIR](https://ehs-prd-01.uchicago.edu/ehsa-ucair/InjuryIllnessIndexUOFC-IT.html).

If there is an emergency, call 773-702-8181 or dial 123 on any campus phone.

#### Reporting COVID-19 Exposure or a Confirmed Case

If you were potentially exposed to COVID-19 or your COVID-19 test results come back positive, reach out immediately to C19HealthReport@uchicago.edu.

Recording and Deletion Policies for Academic Year 2020-1

The Recording and Deletion Policies for the current academic year can be found in the Student Manual under [Petitions, Audio & Video Recording on Campus](https://studentmanual.uchicago.edu/administrative-policies/additional-administrative-regulations/petitions-audio-video-recording-on-campus/).

Do not record, share, or disseminate any course sessions, videos, transcripts, audio, or chats.
Do not share links for the course to those not currently enrolled.
Any Zoom cloud recordings will be automatically deleted 90 days after the completion of the recording.
Attendance

Absent any extraordinary circumstances, we expect students to attend all lectures and discussions. That said, we do not keep track of attendance in this class and no part of your final grade is computed based on your attendance to lectures or discussions.

Students who have been exposed to or who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should contact [UChicago Student Wellness](https://wellness.uchicago.edu/) immediately to be tested, and reach out to their area Dean of Students to request accommodations for classes until:

* At least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared and;
* At least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery- defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath).

#### Special pass/fail policy for CS majors in 2020-2021

Students who are majoring in Computer Science will be allowed to use up to two courses taken for a Pass in AY21 towards the CS major. Please check this [document](http://majors.cs.uchicago.edu/pass-fail-20-21.html) for details.
